                <br />
                <br /> Article 2. Prior Consent
                <br /> Each customer shall agree with the following statements before using Applications:
                <br />
                <br /> (1) The Company may collect and use information related to Applications (e.g., the frequency of use of each application or function, the location where it was used, information related to the vehicle and In-Car Device, the contents
                of speech and dialogue, error logs) provided that this information does not identify the customer;
                <br /> (2) The information specified in the preceding paragraph may be collected on a regular basis in order to smoothly provide services such as updates related to Applications;
                <br /> (3) The information specified in (1) above may be used by Company, SBR and SBR’s related companies to improve Applications and associated services;
                <br /> (4) Applications may become temporarily unusable due to an interrupted network connection, e.g., if the vehicle enters a tunnel or building, goes behind an intervening object, or outside the network connection area, etc.;
                <br /> (5) When a customer posts information through such services as Twitter, Facebook and Google, customer location information is sent as a part of the posted information;
                <br /> (6) Any customer using such services as Twitter, Facebook and Google shall comply with their terms of service;
                <br /> (7) Location information (information on a current location, current destination, etc.) displayed on the customer’s terminal may not be accurate;
                <br /> (8) If a customer violates this Terms of Use and causes damage to the Company and/or SBR, the customer shall compensate for the damage; and
